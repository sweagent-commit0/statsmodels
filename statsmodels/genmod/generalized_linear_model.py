This array can be 1d or 2d.\n        Binomial family models accept a 2d array with two columns. If\n        supplied, each observation is expected to be [success, failure].\n    exog : array_like\n        A nobs x k array where `nobs` is the number of observations and `k`\n        is the number of regressors. An intercept is not included by default\n        and should be added by the user (models specified using a formula\n        include an intercept by default).

To specify the binomial distribution\n        family = sm.family.Binomial()\n        Each family can take a link instance as an argument.  See\n        statsmodels.family.family for more information.\n    offset : array_like or None\n        An offset to be included in the model.  If provided, must be\n        an array whose length is the number of rows in exog.\n    exposure : array_like or None\n        Log(exposure) will be added to the linear prediction in the model.\n        Exposure is only valid if the log link is used. If provided, it must be\n        an array with the same length as endog.\n    freq_weights : array_like\n        1d array of frequency weights. The default is None.

See\n        statsmodels.families.family.fitted of the distribution family for more\n        information.\n    n_trials : ndarray\n        See Notes.

Frequency weights will keep the number\n    of observations consistent, but the degrees of freedom will change to\n    reflect the new weights.\n\n    Variance weights (referred to in other packages as analytic weights) are\n    used when ``endog`` represents an an average or mean. This relies on the\n    assumption that that the inverse variance scales proportionally to the\n    weight--an observation that is deemed more credible should have less\n    variance and therefore have more weight. For the ``Poisson`` family--which\n    assumes that occurrences scale proportionally with time--a natural practice\n    would be to use the amount of time as the variance weight and set ``endog``\n    to be a rate (occurrences per period of time). Similarly, using a\n    compound Poisson family, namely ``Tweedie``, makes a similar assumption\n    about the rate (or frequency) of occurrences having variance proportional to\n    time.\n\n    Both frequency and variance weights are verified for all basic results with\n    nonrobust or heteroscedasticity robust ``cov_type``. Other robust\n    covariance types have not yet been verified, and at least the small sample\n    correction is currently not based on the correct total frequency count.\n\n    Currently, all residuals are not weighted by frequency, although they may\n    incorporate ``n_trials`` for ``Binomial`` and ``var_weights``\n\n    +---------------+----------------------------------+\n    | Residual Type | Applicable weights               |\n    +===============+==================================+\n    | Anscombe      | ``var_weights``                  |\n    +---------------+----------------------------------+\n    | Deviance      | ``var_weights``                  |\n    +---------------+----------------------------------+\n    | Pearson       | ``var_weights`` and ``n_trials`` |\n    +---------------+----------------------------------+\n    | Reponse       | ``n_trials``                     |\n    +---------------+----------------------------------+\n    | Working       | ``n_trials``                     |\n    +---------------+----------------------------------+\n\n    WARNING: Loglikelihood and deviance are not valid in models where\n    scale is equal to 1 (i.e., ``Binomial``, ``NegativeBinomial``, and\n    ``Poisson``).

            optimization. Default is `lstsq` which uses the same underlying
            svd based approach as 'pinv', but is faster during iterations.
            'lstsq' and 'pinv' regularize the estimate in singular and
            near-singular cases by truncating small singular values based
            on `rcond` of the respective numpy.linalg function. 'qr' is

        The penalty is the ``elastic net`` penalty, which is a
        combination of L1 and L2 penalties.

        The function that is minimized is:

            Maximum number of iterations
        L1_wt  : float

    Compute prediction results for GLM compatible models.

    Options and return class depend on whether "which" is None or not.

    Parameters
    ----------
    exog : array_like, optional
        The values for which you want to predict.
    exposure : array_like, optional
        Exposure time values, only can be used with the log link
        function.
    offset : array_like, optional
        Offset values.
    transform : bool, optional
        If the model was fit via a formula, do you want to pass
        exog through the formula. Default is True. E.g., if you fit
        a model y ~ log(x1) + log(x2), and transform is True, then
        you can pass a data structure that contains x1 and x2 in
        their original form. Otherwise, you'd need to log the data
        first.
    which : 'mean', 'linear', 'var'(optional)
        Statitistic to predict. Default is 'mean'.
        If which is None, then the deprecated keyword "linear" applies.
        If which is not None, then a generic Prediction results class will
        be returned. Some options are only available if which is not None.
        See notes.

        - 'mean' returns the conditional expectation of endog E(y | x),
          i.e. inverse of the model's link function of linear predictor.
        - 'linear' returns the linear predictor of the mean function.
        - 'var_unscaled' variance of endog implied by the likelihood model.
          This does not include scale or var_weights.

    linear : bool
        The ``linear` keyword is deprecated and will be removed,
        use ``which`` keyword instead.
        If which is None, then the linear keyword is used, otherwise it will
        be ignored.
        If True and which is None, the linear predicted values are returned.
        If False or None, then the statistic specified by ``which`` will be
        returned.
    average : bool
        Keyword is only used if ``which`` is not None.
        If average is True, then the mean prediction is computed, that is,
        predictions are computed for individual exog and then the average
        over observation is used.
        If average is False, then the results are the predictions for all
        observations, i.e. same length as ``exog``.
    agg_weights : ndarray, optional
        Keyword is only used if ``which`` is not None.
        Aggregation weights, only used if average is True.
    row_labels : list of str or None
        If row_lables are provided, then they will replace the generated
        labels.

    Returns
    -------
    prediction_results : instance of a PredictionResults class.
        The prediction results instance contains prediction and prediction
        variance and can on demand calculate confidence intervals and summary
        tables for the prediction of the mean and of new observations.
        The Results class of the return depends on the value of ``which``.

    Notes
    -----
    Changes in statsmodels 0.14: The ``which`` keyword has been added.
    If ``which`` is None, then the behavior is the same as in previous
    versions, and returns the mean and linear prediction results.
    If the ``which`` keyword is not None, then a generic prediction results
    class is returned and is not backwards compatible with the old prediction
    results class, e.g. column names of summary_frame differs.
    There are more choices for the returned predicted statistic using
    ``which``. More choices will be added in the next release.
    Two additional keyword, average and agg_weights options are now also
    available if ``which`` is not None.
    In a future version ``which`` will become not None and the backwards
    compatible prediction results class will be removed.

            - 'dydx' - dy/dx - No transformation is made and marginal effects
              are returned.  This is the default.
            - 'eyex' - estimate elasticities of variables in `exog` --

            see notes below.
        atexog : array_like, optional
            Optionally, you can provide the exogenous variables over which to
            get the marginal effects.  This should be a dictionary with the key
            as the zero-indexed column number and the value of the dictionary.
            Default is None for all independent variables less the constant.
        dummy : bool, optional
            If False, treats binary variables (if present) as continuous.  This
            is the default.  Else if True, treats binary variables as
            changing from 0 to 1.  Note that any variable that is either 0 or 1
            is treated as binary.  Each binary variable is treated separately
            for now.
        count : bool, optional
            If False, treats count variables (if present) as continuous.  This
            is the default.  Else if True, the marginal effect is the
            change in probabilities when each observation is increased by one.

        Notes
        -----
        Interpretations of methods:
