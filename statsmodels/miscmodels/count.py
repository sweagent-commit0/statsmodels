changes:
added offset and zero-inflated version of Poisson
 - kind of ok, need better test cases,
 - a nan in ZIP bse, need to check hessian calculations
 - found error in ZIP loglike
 - all tests pass with

Issues
------
* If true model is not zero-inflated then numerical Hessian for ZIP has zeros
  for the inflation probability and is not invertible.
  -> hessian inverts and bse look ok if row and column are dropped, pinv also works
* GenericMLE: still get somewhere (where?)
   "CacheWriteWarning: The attribute 'bse' cannot be overwritten"
* bfgs is too fragile, does not come back
* `nm` is slow but seems to work
* need good start_params and their use in genericmle needs to be checked for
  consistency, set as attribute or method (called as attribute)
* numerical hessian needs better scaling

* check taking parts out of the loop, e.g. factorial(endog) could be precalculated
