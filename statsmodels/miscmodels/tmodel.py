"""Linear Model with Student-t distributed errors

Because the t distribution has fatter tails than the normal distribution, it
can be used to model observations with heavier tails and observations that have
some outliers. For the latter case, the t-distribution provides more robust
estimators for mean or mean parameters (what about var?).

TODO
----
* add starting values based on OLS
* bugs: store_params does not seem to be defined, I think this was a module
        global for debugging - commented out
* parameter restriction: check whether version with some fixed parameters works

        Parameters
        ----------
        params : ndarray
            The parameters of the model. The last 2 parameters are degrees of
            freedom and scale.

        Returns
        -------
        loglike : ndarray
            The log likelihood of the model evaluated at `params` for each
            observation defined by self.endog and self.exog.

        Notes
        -----
        .. math:: \\ln L=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left[-\\lambda_{i}+y_{i}x_{i}^{\\prime}\\beta-\\ln y_{i}!\\right]

        The t distribution is the standard t distribution and not a standardized
        t distribution, which means that the scale parameter is not equal to the
        standard deviation.

        self.fixed_params and self.expandparams can be used to fix some
        parameters. (I doubt this has been tested in this model.)
