    ----------
    count : array_like

    nobs : arrat_like
        Currently this is total exposure time of the count variable.

        See Notes for available methods.
    alternative : {'two-sided', 'smaller', 'larger'}
        alternative hypothesis, which can be two-sided or either one of the
        one-sided tests.
    dispersion : float
        Dispersion scale coefficient for Poisson QMLE. Default is that the
        data follows a Poisson distribution. Dispersion different from 1
        correspond to excess-dispersion in Poisson quasi-likelihood (GLM).
        Dispersion coeffficient different from one is currently only used in
        wald and score method.

    Returns
    -------
    HolderTuple instance with test statistic, pvalue and other attributes.

    Notes
    -----
    The implementatio of the hypothesis test is mainly based on the references
    for the confidence interval, see confint_poisson.

    Available methods are:

    - "score" : based on score test, uses variance under null value
    - "wald" : based on wald test, uses variance base on estimated rate.
    - "waldccv" : based on wald test with 0.5 count added to variance
      computation. This does not use continuity correction for the center of
      the confidence interval.
    - "exact-c" central confidence interval based on gamma distribution
    - "midp-c" : based on midp correction of central exact confidence interval.
      this uses numerical inversion of the test function. not vectorized.
    - "sqrt" : based on square root transformed counts
    - "sqrt-a" based on Anscombe square root transformation of counts + 3/8.

    The function is vectorized for all methods except "midp-c", which uses
    an iterative method to invert the hypothesis test function.

    All current methods are central, that is the probability of each tail is
    smaller or equal to alpha / 2. The one-sided interval limits can be
    obtained by doubling alpha.

    Notes

    Methods are mainly based on Barker (2002) [1]_ and Swift (2009) [3]_.

    Available methods are:

    - "exact-c" central confidence interval based on gamma distribution
    - "score" : based on score test, uses variance under null value
    - "wald" : based on wald test, uses variance base on estimated rate.
    - "waldccv" : based on wald test with 0.5 count added to variance
      computation. This does not use continuity correction for the center of
      the confidence interval.
    - "midp-c" : based on midp correction of central exact confidence interval.
      this uses numerical inversion of the test function. not vectorized.
    - "jeffreys" : based on Jeffreys' prior. computed using gamma distribution
    - "sqrt" : based on square root transformed counts
    - "sqrt-a" based on Anscombe square root transformation of counts + 3/8.
    - "sqrt-centcc" will likely be dropped. anscombe with continuity corrected
      center.
      (Similar to R survival cipoisson, but without the 3/8 right shift of
      the confidence interval).

    sqrt-cent is the same as sqrt-a, using a different computation, will be
    deleted.

    sqrt-v is a corrected square root method attributed to vandenbrouke, which
    might also be deleted.

    Todo:

    - missing dispersion,
    - maybe split nobs and exposure (? needed in NB). Exposure could be used
      to standardize rate.
    - modified wald, switch method if count=0.

    The hypothesis test for compare="diff" are mainly based on Ng et al 2007
    and ...

    - wald
    - score
    - etest-score
    - etest-wald

    Note the etests use the constraint maximum likelihood estimate (cmle) as
    parameters for the underlying Poisson probabilities. The constraint cmle
    parameters are the same as in the score test.
    The E-test in Krishnamoorty and Thomson uses a moment estimator instead of
    the score estimator.

    Notes
    -----
    This is implemented as two one-sided tests at the minimum effect boundaries
    (low, upp) with (nominal) size alpha / 2 each.
    The size of the test is the sum of the two one-tailed tests, which
    corresponds to an equal-tailed two-sided test.
    If low and upp are equal, then the result is the same as the standard
    two-sided test.

    The p-value is computed as `2 * min(pvalue_low, pvalue_upp)` in analogy to
    two-sided equal-tail tests.

    In large samples the nominal size of the test will be below alpha.
